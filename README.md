# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


update your local files to match the latest version in your GitHub repository


Check the Current Status
Ensure you don’t have uncommitted changes that might get overwritten. Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
git status
If there are uncommitted changes, either commit them or stash them using:

bash
Copy
Edit
git stash
Pull the Latest Changes
Fetch the latest changes from the remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git fetch
Then merge those changes into your local branch:

bash
Copy
Edit
git pull origin <branch-name>
Replace <branch-name> with the branch you want to update (e.g., main or master).

Resolve Any Conflicts (if applicable)
If there are merge conflicts, Git will pause and let you resolve them manually. After resolving conflicts, mark the files as resolved and continue:

bash
Copy
Edit
git add <conflicted-file>
git commit
Verify the Update
Check if your local files are now updated:

bash
Copy
Edit
git log --oneline
This shows the latest commits, confirming your local repository is synced.

Optional: Discard Local Changes Without Committing
If you don’t need to keep your local changes, you can reset to match the remote repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git reset --hard origin/<branch-name>
This will overwrite your local changes and make your local branch identical to the remote branch. Use this with caution.
